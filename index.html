      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Automotive racing, whether physical or virtual, is a complex and multifaceted field where split-second decisions could mean the difference between winning, losing, or crashing. This project aims to revolutionize the racing industry by automating the process and improving performance beyond human capabilities using reinforcement learning.
      </p>
      <p>
        The traditional methods of improving racing performance involve manual training, driver experience, and intuitive decision-making. However, with the advent of machine learning and artificial intelligence, opportunities arise to develop automated and self-learning systems for racing.

      <h2>Project Details</h2>
      <p>
        The goal of this project is to develop a reinforcement learning (RL) model that learns to race autonomously, starting from no knowledge of racing and improving over time through trial and error. The RL model utilizes the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, which is robust and efficient in handling complex tasks.
      </p>
      <p>
        The model is trained in a simulated racing environment that mimics real-world conditions. It receives rewards for reaching checkpoints, maintaining high speed, and minimizing crashes. After several training iterations, the RL model demonstrates significant improvement in racing performance, showcasing valuable racing strategies learned during the process.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although the model still struggles with certain complex scenarios, this project serves as a case study for how reinforcement learning can tackle real-world tasks and potentially revolutionize the racing industry. The findings could also contribute to other areas such as autonomous vehicle navigation and traffic management.

      <h2>Future Work</h2>
      <p>
        While the project has shown promising results, there is still room for improvement and further research. Future work could focus on incorporating more advanced RL algorithms or hybrid approaches, enhancing the realism of the training environment, or transferring the learned policies to real-world vehicles.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, developing an understanding of how the model makes decisions could provide insights into effective racing strategies and even contribute to safer driving practices in general.
